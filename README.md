# My-TodoList
Sticky Note on Window 10 is slow and  inconvenience when it starts up. So, I make my own TodoList.
It will show task list whenever open the new tab and save all tasks when browser closed. Because I implement this without framework, it can work well without internet. Moreover, it is simple, lightweight and easy to use.
.
Finally, it is not too hard to implement but it is quite convenience. You can also install my extension by load file TodoList.crx on your browser.
